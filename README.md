# Library-Management | SQL
An SQL-based project focused on designing and managing a Library Management System. It covers database creation, table relationships, CRUD operations, and query-based analysis to track books, members, issued records, and returns using core SQL concepts.

# Tools & Technologies

  - PostgreSQL
  - SQL
  - pgAdmin 4

# Dataset
The dataset contains library management details such as:

  - Branch information
  - Employee details
  - Member records
  - Book details
  - Issued book status
  - Returned book status

# Objectives

  - Create and manage a Library Management System database

  - Design tables for branches, employees, members, and books

  - Perform CRUD operations to maintain library records

  - Write SQL queries to track book issues, returns, and availability

# Key Analysis Performed

  - Insertion of new book records into the library
  - Updating member details and deleting issued records
  - Tracking books issued by specific employees
  - Identifying members who have issued more than one book
  - Creating summary tables using CTAS
  - Analyzing books by category and rental price
  - Calculating total rental income by book category
  - Identifying expensive books based on rental price
  - Finding books that have not yet been returned
  - Listing employees along with their branch manager and branch details
  
# SQL Concepts Used

  - Table creation and constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY)
  
  - CRUD operations (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  
  - JOINs (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
  
  - Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM)
  
  - GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
  
  - CASE-independent filtering
  
  - CTAS (Create Table As Select)
  
# Findings

  - Books are distributed across multiple categories with varying rental prices

  - Certain categories contribute more to total rental income
  
  - Some members issue multiple books, indicating higher library usage
  
  - Not all issued books are returned, highlighting pending returns
  
  - Employee and branch-level tracking improves visibility of library operations

- Summary tables help in faster reporting and analysis
# Conclusion

  This project demonstrates the use of SQL for managing a structured library database. 
  
  It highlights database design, data manipulation, and query-based analysis to support efficient library operations.
